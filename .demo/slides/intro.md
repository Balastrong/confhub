# TanStack Start strengths

- **Real type-safety**: without you actually having to write types
- **Isomorphism**: comprehensive control over what runs where (client vs server)
- **Developer experience**: the framework helps you, doesn't fight you
- **Framework agnostic**: shared core, you can use it with React and Solid (and... ?)
