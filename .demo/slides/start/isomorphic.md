# What does isomorphic mean here?

- Your code can run on **both** server and client
- You can choose to run code **only** on server or client
- You can define **different behaviors** for server and client

<br />

```ts
// âœ… This runs on BOTH server and client
function formatPrice(price: number) {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD',
  }).format(price)
}
```
