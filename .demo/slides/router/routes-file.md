# Routes definition: file-based

Routes are autogenerated from the files in the `routes` directory.

[TODO: Add an image?]

Nesting, pathless routes & co are defined though the naming convention of the files.

**Recommended approach**! Vite plugin makes it even better to use (and Start uses it too).
