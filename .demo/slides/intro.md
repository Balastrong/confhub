    - No `"use server"`/`"use client"` directives
- One of the best client-side routers to date
- Focus on highly interactive applications
- Well integrated with client-side caching (TanStack Query)

# Superior Developer Experience

- Extreme Typesafety without writing any types
- Minimal boilerplate
    - Little to no configuration
    - A Vite plugin autogenerates the boring parts
- Easier to migrate & learn (client-first, no unnecessary constraints)
