# Routes definition

Use your favourite approach between file-based, code-based or virtual

# Routes Features

You can do pretty much everything you need with all three definition approaches, including:

- Path parameters
- Pathless routes
- Nested routes
- Shared layouts
- Auth guards
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- ...everything, really!

# Routes definition: file-based

Routes are autogenerated from the files in the `routes` directory.

[TODO: Add an image?]

Nesting, pathless routes & co are defined though the naming convention of the files.

**Recommended approach**! Vite plugin makes it even better to use (and Start uses it too).

# Routes definition: code-based

Manually handle and maintain routes in your code

```ts
import { createRootRoute, createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router"

const rootRoute = createRootRoute()

const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts",
})

const postRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "$postId",
})
```

# Routes definition - virtual

Inspired by Remix, manually reference components or folders/files to build your own routes tree.

```ts
import { rootRoute, route, index, layout, physical } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes"

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  index("index.tsx"),
  layout("pathlessLayout.tsx", [
    route("/dashboard", "app/dashboard.tsx", [
      index("app/dashboard-index.tsx"),
      route("/invoices", "app/dashboard-invoices.tsx", [
        index("app/invoices-index.tsx"),
        route("$id", "app/invoice-detail.tsx"),
      ]),
    ]),
    physical("/posts", "posts"),
  ]),
])
```
